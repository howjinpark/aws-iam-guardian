# Requirements Document

## Introduction

현재 IAM Manager 시스템에서 메뉴 레벨의 권한 제어는 구현되어 있지만, 개별 기능 레벨에서의 세밀한 권한 제어가 부족한 상황입니다. 조회자(viewer) 권한 사용자가 IAM 사용자 페이지의 "분석" 버튼을 통해 권한 분석 기능에 접근할 수 있는 보안 취약점이 발견되었습니다.

이 스펙은 역할 기반 접근 제어(RBAC)를 강화하여 모든 기능에 대해 적절한 권한 검사를 구현하는 것을 목표로 합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: 기능별 권한 제어

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure that users can only access functions appropriate to their role, so that sensitive operations are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a viewer role user attempts to access analysis functions THEN the system SHALL deny access and show an appropriate error message
2. WHEN a viewer role user clicks the "분석" button in IAM Users page THEN the system SHALL display "접근 권한 없음" message
3. WHEN an analyst role user accesses analysis functions THEN the system SHALL allow access
4. WHEN an admin role user accesses any function THEN the system SHALL allow access

### Requirement 2: 컴포넌트 레벨 권한 가드

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable component for role-based access control, so that I can easily protect any UI element based on user roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a protected feature THEN the system SHALL provide a RoleGuard component
2. WHEN RoleGuard wraps a component THEN it SHALL check user permissions before rendering
3. WHEN user lacks required permissions THEN RoleGuard SHALL show appropriate fallback content
4. WHEN user has required permissions THEN RoleGuard SHALL render the protected component

### Requirement 3: API 레벨 권한 검증

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all API endpoints to verify user permissions, so that unauthorized access is prevented at the backend level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes an API request THEN the system SHALL verify the user's role permissions
2. WHEN a viewer attempts to access analysis APIs THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden
3. WHEN an unauthorized request is made THEN the system SHALL log the attempt for audit purposes
4. WHEN role verification fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4: 일관된 권한 매트릭스

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a clear definition of what each role can access, so that permissions are consistently applied across the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining role permissions THEN the system SHALL maintain a centralized permission matrix
2. WHEN a new feature is added THEN it SHALL be properly categorized in the permission matrix
3. WHEN roles are updated THEN all related permissions SHALL be consistently applied
4. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL use the centralized permission definition

### Requirement 5: 사용자 피드백 개선

**User Story:** As a user with limited permissions, I want clear feedback when I cannot access a feature, so that I understand why access is denied and what I can do instead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access is denied THEN the system SHALL show a clear explanation message
2. WHEN showing permission errors THEN the system SHALL indicate the required role level
3. WHEN user lacks permissions THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative actions if available
4. WHEN displaying error messages THEN they SHALL be user-friendly and informative

### Requirement 6: 감사 로그 강화

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all permission-related events to be logged, so that I can track unauthorized access attempts and ensure security compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access is denied THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with user details
2. WHEN permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL record the verification result
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL create a security audit entry
4. WHEN reviewing audit logs THEN permission-related events SHALL be easily identifiable
